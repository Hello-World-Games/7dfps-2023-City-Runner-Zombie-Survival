# 7-day FPS Jam 2023 Project

This is my serisouly unfinished project.

If you want to know what happened, this part is for you.

## Story

So to keep it short, I didn't really like Zombie FPS games, so when I signed up, I forgot about it within an hour because I had already gotten bored. If I work on smeonthing, it's on something I like. Or something I'm being paid for. This was my first jam too. Anyway, I remembered about this about 30 minutes before the project was due and made this.

## Want to work on it?

You don't even have to credit me. I found the FPS controller from the marketplace, and teh city too. I tweaked them a little bit, but it is still far from perfection. Unity took 15 minutes to load, then the assets took up about 13 minutes. I did some tweaking in like 30 seconds, to make it playable, and then here it is.

Feel free to use it in your own projects, is my point.
